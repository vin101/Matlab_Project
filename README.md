# Matlab_Project
A Matlab side Project to make a real time translator using familiar Objects

 We have observed that senior citizens have trouble interacting with modern technology,to address that we plan to use familiar objects to help them leverage technology.We are aiming to make a table lamp which can take photographs of documents placed under its camera (for the prototype we plan to tape a smart phone to the lamp) and send it to Matlab, which then reads the text from the image using OCR and this text is translated to the users regional language using Google Translate API. Thus enabling the user to read any document in her own regional language.
